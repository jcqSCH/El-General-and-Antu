# El-General-and-Antu

- Backup of all icons and themes (El General and Antü), originally made by:
      > https://github.com/fabianalexisinostroza

- I don't know why, but it seems that Fabián Alexis (the author of this awesome project) just deleted his repositories.

- Since I had this files in my HD, I'm making them available again for the ones that been looking for the original `SVG` icons.
